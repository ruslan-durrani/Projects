# Application name
No-Hassel
# Description
The "Enhancing Accessibility and Communication for Individuals with Visual and Speech
Impairments" project focuses on developing the "No-Hassel" mobile app to address the
challenges faced by individuals with visual and speech impairments in accessing and utilizing
mobile applications. By incorporating features such as image recognition, text-to-speech
conversion, and speech-to-text functionality, the app aims to improve navigation,
information access, and communication for its users. This report presents a case study on
the "No-Hassel" app, examining its effectiveness in enhancing accessibility and
communication for individuals with visual and speech impairments. The findings and
recommendations derived from this study contribute to the field of HCI and highlight the
importance of inclusive design in creating an accessible digital environment.
